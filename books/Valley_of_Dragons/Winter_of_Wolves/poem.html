<strong>Winter of Wolves</strong>
The valley sleeps in ice and snow,
Where Silver River ceased to flow.
The sun is pale, the hearths burn low,
And whispers ride the winds that blow.

The wolves descend with eyes of ice,
Their howls a chill, their fangs a vice.
They circle fast, furious they attack,
Yet dragon-fire drives back the pack.

Through tundra bleak, through forests wide,
The mountain giants guard her pride.
Freyja’s voice, both cold and stern,
Declares no spring shall ever return.

But Alaric stands, his sword held true,
He faced her wrath and cut it through.
He breaks her crown of frost and fear—
The valley’s spring returns this year.

Now sunlight warms both field and glade,
The wolves retreat, the ice has swayed.
The people cheer, their hearts rejoice:
The valley lives by freedom’s choice.
