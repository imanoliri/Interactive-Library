<strong>Attack of the Dark God</strong>
Darkness spread in ash and smoke.
Goblins, orcs, and demons came,
Burning fields in fear and flame.

The riders rose, with dragons proud,
Their wings a shield, their roars a shroud.
Silver, green, and crimson flame,
Gawain, Percival, Galahad’s name.

From ruined homes, a child survived,
Alaric’s fate was thus derived.
Raised with love, yet forged by loss,
He chose the rider’s path, no cross.

At Greystone’s pass, in battle dire,
The Lich King struck with frost and fire.
Yet Alaric stood, though pierced with pain,
His courage saved the knights again.

The Sword of Dawn, by fate bestowed,
Led him to the Dark God’s throne.
Steel and spirit, side by side,
Broke the chains of death and pride.

Now in songs his tale is told,
Of freedom’s flame, of hearts made bold.
The Valley thrives, the dark undone,
By knight and dragon—light as one.
