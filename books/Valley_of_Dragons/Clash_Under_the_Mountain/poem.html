<strong>Clash Under the Mountain</strong>
Peace rested bright in the Valley’s sky,
Till a dwarf came with a worried eye,
“Khazad-Throm is bleeding—help us, or we die.”

The paladins met in Castle Tarn,
Gawain weighed risk, Percival stayed calm,
And Alaric swore: “We answer the call of harm.”

Through wind-cut passes and secret stone,
A rune awoke, and gates groaned,
To lava-lit halls where iron shone,
And dwarven songs like anvils droned.

King Thordal welcomed them, proud and grave,
With feasts and mead in chambers great,
The knights learned the White Fang’s ways,
Till war-maps spread and courage braved.

At Durin’s Chasm, two bridges held,
At Iron Footing, shield-walls swelled,
In Broken Shard, the goblin horde was felled,
As Alaric’s sword and the dragon-fire compelled.

Deep in the Burrow, in filth and dread,
Grishnak rose, with stolen gold for bed,
Till Bhor’s spear and Alaric’s blade struck red,
And victory was shared —two realms now friends.
