After the defeat of the Dark God and the long, unnatural Winter of Wolves, the bond between humans, elves, and dragons was stronger than ever. The Dragon Rider Order, the shining symbol of this unity, stood as the valley&rsquo;s shield, led by the three legendary paladins: Gawain, the master of strategy; Percival, the wisest of the three; and Alaric, the first human paladin and a hero to all the free peoples. Their unwavering presence protected the joyful life in River City and the magical culture of the Forest City, a testament to the freedom they had fiercely defended.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">One crisp afternoon, as the Order&rsquo;s council met within the high walls of Castle Tarn, a shadow fell across the sunlit courtyard. It was a dragon descending with unusual haste. As the great beast landed, its rider, an elf knight, dismounted and hurried toward the hall. Following him was a figure unfamiliar to the valley: a dwarf, small but broad, clad in heavy, travel-worn armor. His movements were bold but his face etched with worry. His beard was braided with iron rings, and his proud brow was ever so slightly tainted with a barely visible sorrow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>B</span><span class="c2">efore them was Roric, a true living representative of the proud, stubborn and loyal people from the nearby Dwarven Kingdom of Khazad-Throm, a magnificent, legendary realm of stone hidden deep under a mountain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 340.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image11.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 340.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The paladins and the assembled knights listened in grave silence as Roric delivered his message. His voice, naturally gruff and booming, recounted the relentless, grinding war their kingdom faced within their mountain home. Goblins and Trolls, creatures of malice and brute strength, had massed their forces. These vile attackers were driving the dwarves from precious, ancestral mines, and worse, they were threatening the ancient halls of their Capital. The dwarven warriors, though renowned for their bravery, discipline, and unyielding defense, were stretched to their absolute limits. If the famously proud dwarves were calling for help, their defense must have been perilously close to faltering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We have fought alone for too long, noble Paladins,&rdquo; Roric concluded, his eyes fixed on the heroes with an expression of shame. &ldquo;The Dragon Rider Order is famous throughout the realms&mdash;the only power great enough to turn this tide of vermin. We say: lend us your strength, your skill, and your dragons&rsquo; fire to defeat this vile menace. Our world under the mountain will surely fall without your aid, and with it, the light of one of the free world&rsquo;s strongest kingdoms.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The paladins withdrew to a quiet corner of the hall to deliberate, the dwarf&rsquo;s emotional words hanging heavy in the air, a stark reminder that even in peace, threats lurked in other parts of the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Their need is great, and their peril is real,&rdquo; Percival stated, his voice a steady, thoughtful murmur that commanded attention. &ldquo;To allow such a kingdom of honorable, industrious people to fall would send a catastrophic message. It would embolden the forces of darkness everywhere and weaken the forces of light in this world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gawain, ever practical and focused on the safety of their home, tapped on the war-table map&mdash;a map that, until this moment, had ended at the valley&rsquo;s border. &ldquo;Their kingdom is far, and to commit our forces is a grave strategic risk to the valley itself. The valley is safe now, but what if the Dark God&#39;s lingering remnants or a new enemy sees our ranks thinned by this far-off war? We must weigh the cost against our primary duty to protect our own people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">All eyes turned to Alaric. The human paladin, who had once been a war orphan and now carried the spirit of the valley&rsquo;s hope, stood silent for a long moment, the familiar feeling of duty and empathy stirring fiercely in his heart. He remembered the kindness shown to him, the unity that had saved the valley from annihilation, and the constant fear of the Dark God&rsquo;s tyranny. His gaze was steady as he spoke, his voice clear and resonant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The Dragon Rider Order was founded not just to protect this valley alone, but to defend all those who live in peace and freedom,&rdquo; Alaric said, his voice carrying the conviction of his experience. &ldquo;We cannot call ourselves champions of the light if we let darkness consume our neighbors. The fear Roric carries is the same fear we knew when the Dark God first attacked. We have the power to help, and therefore, we have the duty. Let us show Khazad-Throm what the friendship of the valley is worth, and what a united front against chaos can achieve.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Alaric&rsquo;s words resonated deeply with the knights. Gawain, nodding slowly, began to sketch out a route for the expedition and a logistical plan for resource management, his strategic mind already at work. Percival smiled, the wisdom in his eyes confirming the righteousness of the decision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then let it be known,&rdquo; Percival proclaimed, his voice ringing with wise authority. &ldquo;The Dragon Rider Order shall answer the call. Paladin Alaric, you shall lead this expedition. We will ride to the Dwarven Kingdom of Khazad-Throm, and together, we shall face the evil under the mountain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The decision was made, sealed by the solemn agreement of the Paladins of the Valley of Dragons. They turned their full attention to the intense preparations. A new adventure, one that would take them far from their peaceful home and test their diplomacy as well as their strength, had begun. The war against the forces of darkness was not yet over, but the light of hope&mdash;carried on the wings of dragons&mdash;would soon arrive at the doorstep of the besieged dwarven kingdom.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c1 c7" id="h.lqb0htitv36f"><span class="c5">Chapter 2: Kingdom under the Mountain</span></h1><p class="c1"><span>The expedition left the Valley of Dragons a few days later, </span><span>during an idyllic and sunny day in that peaceful sanctuary</span><span class="c2">. The chosen force was small but elite: a dozen Dragon Riders and their dragons, including the veteran knight Caradoc. At the front marched Paladin Alaric, his armor gleaming under the sun, his mind set on the task ahead. Beside him traveled Roric, the stout dwarven messenger, his worry now tempered with a flicker of hope and his pride satisfied by the help conceded. A crucial addition to the company was Eloran, the elf plantsmith who had become Alaric&#39;s friend, now serving as the Dragon Rider Order&#39;s diplomatic envoy. Eloran&#39;s deep understanding of ancient cultures and his patient temperament made him the perfect bridge between the peoples of the valley and the proud and sometimes hard-headed dwarves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 624.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image17.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 624.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The journey was fairly long on foot, leading them away from the valley&rsquo;s surrounding familiar paths and into the unforgiving, stony heart of a mountain range. Roric guided them with a confident stride, navigating treacherous cold slopes and narrow, wind-battered passes known only to his people. The landscape became a fortress of granite and cold air, yet the Dragon Riders pressed on, their resolve fueled by Alaric&rsquo;s unwavering dedication.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 624.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 624.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Finally, Roric led them to a vast, shadowed crevice: the legendary, secret entrance to Khazad-Throm. With a solemn touch of a hidden rune, the rock wall groaned, and a gigantic, sculpted stone gate swung inward on hinges older than the humankind itself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">They stepped from the biting cold of the mountain into a world of startling wonder. A colossal cavern opened before them, a magnificent subterranean city carved from the very rock. The air was warm, with the scent of coal, steam, wrought iron, and freshly cut stone. Rivers of magma flowed in deep, engineered channels, casting a dancing, fiery glow upon great statues of dwarven heroes and engraved obsidian walls. The clang of hammers on anvils, like a distant choir, and the endless rumbling of mining carts filled the air&mdash;the vibrant, industrious song of the dwarven people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Dragon Riders were led through halls of breathtaking scale, past vast pillared vaults and great forges where the fiercest fires of the realm burned. Hundreds of dwarves&mdash;stocky, tireless, and clad in heavy leather attire&mdash;paused their work to stare at the legendary Dragon Riders passing by. They were led directly to the heart of the capital and the great throne room, a hall of breathtaking magnificence where the mountain itself seemed to have bowed to the artistry of its inhabitants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 340.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 340.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">There, seated on a throne carved from a single, shimmering block of silver-veined stone, was King Thordal, the ruler of Khazad-Throm. He was an older dwarf, his beard a river of white and red, iron-braided locks that cascaded over his ceremonial plate armor. His eyes, though weary, held the fiery resolve of a thousand years of mountain-dwelling kings. He rose to meet Alaric, a kingly gesture that honored the Order.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Welcome, Paladin Alaric, and welcome, Envoy Eloran, to the Kingdom Under the Mountain,&rdquo; King Thordal boomed, his voice echoing in the chamber. &ldquo;The Dragon Rider Order has answered our plea. Khazad-Throm thanks you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For the next two days, the dwarves showered their guests with fierce, generous hospitality. They were given comfortable, stone-hewn chambers, offered feasts of rich roasts, mountain cheeses, deep-brewed ale, and mead, and treated not as foreign dignitaries, but as long-lost, honored kin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Alaric and Eloran spent the time learning about this new world. They toured the magnificent underground mines&mdash;veins of gold, silver, and precious gems stretching further than the eye could see&mdash;and gazed in awe at the monumental statues of the kings of old. Eloran, with his expert plantsmith&rsquo;s curiosity, engaged the dwarven master-smiths, discussing the resilience of mountain-forged steel and the nature of the glowing, mineral-rich moss that illuminated some spots in their halls. Alaric, meanwhile, studied the deep tunnels and ancient passageways, realizing that the kingdom was not merely a city, but a labyrinthine world of its own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It is a marvel of the free world,&rdquo; Alaric told Eloran one night, as they looked out over a deep chasm where a river of magma glowed. &ldquo;A kingdom as old and strong as the elven forests. To lose this to Goblins and Trolls would be a tragedy beyond words.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Eloran nodded, his face lit by the orange glow. &ldquo;A different kind of strength, Alaric. Less magic, more industry. They do not bend to nature; they make it bend to them. But for all their walls, they are trapped. Now, they must ask us to help them fight the evil that has burrowed around them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The time for hospitality was nearing its end. On the third day, King Thordal summoned them once more. The King&rsquo;s face was now a mask of regal worry, and the warmth of the welcoming feast was replaced by the cold reality of war. The Order was rested, the envoys were informed, and the time had come to discuss the terms of their alliance and face the problem that had driven a proud people to ask for help: the very real and present war that raged just beyond the palace&rsquo;s immense stone gates.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c1 c7" id="h.a3ax2ugzuke7"><span class="c5">Chapter 3: The Problem</span></h1><p class="c1"><span>On the morning of the third day, the air in Khazad-Throm&#39;s great halls was no longer filled with the warmth of dwarven hospitality, but with the cold, hard reality of war. King Thordal, seated upon his silver-veined throne, summoned Paladin Alaric and Envoy Eloran to a council of war. </span><span>There,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;a large, detailed map of the kingdom&rsquo;s subterranean tunnels was spread across a massive stone table.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The King&#39;s face was etched with the heavy burden of his crown. &ldquo;My friends of the Valley,&rdquo; he began, his booming voice subdued. &ldquo;We have shown you our home&mdash;its wealth, its strength, and its beauty. Now, it is time to show you its great peril.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He gestured to the map with a gloved hand. &ldquo;For centuries, Khazad-Throm has been a city and a world carved in stone. But we share this mountain with others&mdash;creatures of shadow and malice: the Goblins and the Trolls. They are numerous, vile, and organized. They do not merely raid; they wage war. They have infested the deepest mines, choking off our flow of precious metals, and are now pressing into the outer defenses of the capital itself.

They are a swarm that can be anywhere and everywhere at once. Their numbers are their shield and their spear. The Trolls are brute strength&mdash;hulking beasts that smash our disciplined shield walls and wreak havoc amidst our lines. They are a force that even our best iron struggles to put down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Alaric studied the map, his mind already working on strategy. &ldquo;We will lend you the strength of the Dragon Rider Order, King Thordal. But an alliance requires understanding on all sides. We must agree on the terms of our assistance. Tell us: what is your ultimate objective, and what do you require of us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The King met his gaze. &ldquo;The objective is simple: to crush the Goblins and Trolls completely and permanently. We have no interest in merely driving them back&mdash;they must be annihilated in their burrows. Of the Dragon Riders, we ask for two things: first, your unmatched tactical skill and the aerial advantage of your dragons to break their formations and </span><span>outmaneuver them</span><span>. Second, we ask of your</span><span>&nbsp;equal sharing of the burden during the final assault into their main lair</span><span>. We, the dwarves, will fight a war of tunnels and attrition until then, but a swift, decisive strike is needed to break their morale and their leadership. </span><span>One we cannot win solely with our forces</span><span class="c2">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Eloran, the diplomat, spoke next, his voice calm and precise. &ldquo;And what are the terms of the alliance? The Dragon Riders fight for freedom, not for gold. We seek to secure the light of all free peoples.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">King Thordal stood, resting his hands on the table. &ldquo;Khazad-Throm is a Kingdom of honor. We ask for a formal alliance between your Valley and our Kingdom, a bond of mutual defense against the darkness. When our home is safe, we will offer to establish an embassy in your River City, to share our knowledge of metalwork, and to trade our finely-crafted steel and gems for the resources of your forests and plains. And should you ever face a threat like the one you defeated&mdash;the Dark God&mdash;the strength of the dwarven armies will be yours without hesitation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Alaric and Eloran exchanged a glance. The terms were more than fair. A powerful, disciplined ally deep within the mountains would be an anchor of strength for the free world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;We accept, King Thordal,&rdquo; Alaric stated, his voice firm with a paladin&rsquo;s commitment. &ldquo;The Dragon Rider Order shall fight alongside your people until the last Troll falls and the last Goblin burrows are cleansed. </span><span>We will send a messenger to the Valley to ready an army for the final battle as you request.</span><span class="c2">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The King&#39;s stern face softened with relief, a truly friendly smile finally breaking through. &ldquo;Then let us begin, Paladin Alaric. The fate of my kingdom rests on our steel and your resolve. We will show these foul creatures what Dragon Riders and the mountain dwarves can achieve when we join our forces.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 624.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image19.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 624.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">With the alliance sealed, the war council began in earnest. The hours passed as they pored over the maps, detailing the enemy&#39;s positions, the strategic chokepoints of the caverns, and the most efficient routes for the Order&rsquo;s advance. Alaric realized that the war would not be fought under the open sky, but in the close, echoing confines of a world he did not yet fully understand. The Dragon Riders had come to a world where their familiar strengths&mdash;the wide-open sky, the boundless freedom of flight&mdash;would be constrained, and a new kind of war, a dark labyrinth of war against endless hordes, was about to begin.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c15"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c1 c7" id="h.9p9efeuaglij"><span class="c5">Chapter 4: Battle of Durin&rsquo;s Chasm</span></h1><p class="c1"><span>The days following the sealed alliance were a whirlwind of preparation and hasty activity within the deep halls of Khazad-Throm.

Bhor was a dwarf of legendary stature, his braided beard the color of rusted iron, and his face a roadmap of ancient battles. He was a creature made out of stone and unyielding discipline, a master of defensive lines, shield walls, and the brutal war of attrition common in the tunnels. He wore a grim and respectful skepticism toward the Dragon Riders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Your flyers are magnificent, Paladin Alaric,&rdquo; Bhor admitted one morning, gesturing to the cavern where Vaelor and the others rested. &ldquo;But this is not a war of open skies. We fight in caverns, in darkness, where a hundred hammers can find a dragon&rsquo;s belly faster than an arrow finds a man.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;And yet, General Bhor, there are passages only a dragon can cross,</span><span>&nbsp;and far away foes that only a dragon can touch</span><span>,&rdquo; Alaric countered, tapping a spot on the great stone map. &ldquo;We will not fight </span><span>your way, but </span><span class="c13">our</span><span>&nbsp;way, alongside your dwarves</span><span class="c2">. Where the tunnel opens to a chasm, our speed will break their formations. Where it narrows, your iron wall will hold them.&rdquo; Bhor smiled, satisfied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 340.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 340.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The first and most critical point of engagement was determined: </span><span class="c10">Durin&rsquo;s Chasm</span><span>. It was a massive, ancient crack in the mountain&rsquo;s heart, an abyss several hundred feet deep, spanned only by </span><span>two</span><span>, narrow, stone bridges&mdash;an obvious chokepoint that led directly to the central mines and the </span><span>outermost defenses</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of the capital. The enemy&#39;s main force, having gathered its strength in the deep nearby burrows, was poised to cross it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Paladin </span><span class="c10">Gawain</span><span class="c2">, having also arrived to take command of the Dragon Rider forces, stood with Alaric and Bhor overlooking the chasm from a renovated but old fortified defensive position. The air here was cold, smelling of deep-earth minerals and the faint stench of the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The enemy will come across the bridges in a swarm,&rdquo; Gawain stated, his voice calm, his strategic mind already calculating the movements. &ldquo;Goblins will try to haste through the chokepoint, and overwhelm the defense. Our job is not just to hold the line, but to turn this chasm into a killing field.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">General Bhor nodded, his expression firm. &ldquo;My warriors will form a wall of iron on the near side of the bridge. Our archers will shoot from the fortifications on the hills nearby. They will not falter. But their numbers are endless, Paladin. They will break through eventually.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then we will not let them reach your wall unbroken,&rdquo; Alaric said, as he pointed to the air. &ldquo;The cavern is ample enough and the chasm is deep and wide. Our dragons have practiced flying here. We will use the cavern and the chasm as our sky.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The plan was daring: The Dragon Riders would use the cavern&rsquo;s height to stage their attacks, diving into the chasm to strafe the puny Goblin formations as they crossed the bridge. The fire and shock would sow chaos, scattering the enemy before they reached the dwarven line. This, combined with the archers&rsquo; fire will make the bridges a killing field and the cowardly goblins wouldn&rsquo;t be able to mount a decisive attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For two days, the dwarven army assembled. Hundreds of disciplined, iron-clad warriors marched in perfect silence, taking up their positions behind walls of stone. Ballistae were placed to fire massive, iron-tipped bolts across the chasm. The Dragon Riders, meanwhile, perched on the highest, narrowest ledges, their dragons&rsquo; great wings folded, the knights themselves clad in full armor to protect them from arrows. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The tension was tangible, settling over the chamber like dust. The only sound was the occasional shift of a boot, the faint hiss of a dragon&rsquo;s breath, and the endless void of the mountain itself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then, the quiet shattered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">From the deep shadows on the far side of the cavern, the battle-cries began&mdash;a cacophony of shrieks and growls and war drums that echoed off the stone walls, a sound that spoke of madness and endless numbers. The first wave appeared: a flood of Goblins warriors, small, green, and frantic, surging toward the narrow bridges. Behind them, lines and lines of archers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Alaric felt the familiar, fiery rush of a coming battle, a mix of cold fear and righteous determination. He mounted Vaelor, gripping his sword. The moment the bridge was a carpet of green and grey, a mass of teeming bodies, he gave the order:</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Dragon Riders&mdash;</span><span class="c13">Attack</span><span class="c2">!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The air was immediately split by the roar of great wings and the screech of dragons descending. Alaric and Vaelor led the first wave, dropping from the ceiling and plunging into the great chasm. Vaelor unleashed a torrent of fire, a focused stream that swept the entire width of the bridge, turning the mass of enemy bodies into ash and crooked shadows. The other riders followed suit, their fire and lances carving bloody swaths through the disorganized horde. The Goblins, momentarily stunned, fell into chaos, some scrambling back, others tumbling into the darkness of the chasm below.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 416.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 416.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The dwarves cheered, their taunts of battle echoing in the cavern. But before the Dragon Riders could soar for a second pass, the Goblins executed their counter-move. From behind their lines, dozens of archers&mdash;small, but deadly&mdash;unleashed a coordinated storm of arrows aimed at the dragons in the chasm. The air was thick with dark shafts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve learned quickly!&rdquo; Alaric shouted, pulling Vaelor up and back. To repeat the strafing run would be to sacrifice the dragons. The Dragon Riders were forced to gain altitude and retreat to the high ledges or land behind dwarven fortifications.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">With the Dragon Riders temporarily out of the game, the Goblins, pushed by their commanders, began to cross the bridge in a disorganized but persistent stream. The moment they stepped onto the near side, they were met by the unyielding dwarven shield walls of General Bhor&#39;s veterans. The narrow bridges of the chasm were a powerful choke point; only a small, manageable trickle of the horde reached the dwarven line at any one time, thinned down by dwarven archers shooting from the fortifications on the hills and then they were quickly hacked down by the disciplined axes and spears.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">To break the deadlock, the goblin archers were ordered forward. Dozens of green-skinned bowmen began to swarm onto the bridge itself, advancing past their own shield-wielders. Their goal was clear: to get within range and suppress the superior dwarven archers positioned on the fortifications.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Now,&quot; Gawain said, pressing the attack. &quot;They have traded their safety for an advantage they cannot defend.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">By moving their archers onto the bridge, the Goblins had crowded the chokepoint and presented a dense, irresistible target, as well as distracting the archers from repelling the Dragon Riders. Now they had their opening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alaric, Gawain&mdash;strike the bridge! Leave none standing!&rdquo; General Bhor roared, bringing his hammer up in the air to support the meaning of his words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The dragons roared as they plunged down a second time. This time, the damage was absolute. Vaelor&rsquo;s flame engulfed the Goblins crammed onto the bridge. They had nowhere to scatter, nowhere to run. Their archers, whose arrows had briefly driven the dragons away, were now too densely packed to dodge the fiery revenge. The Goblins were trapped, tactically outmaneuvered, and their ranks were incinerated in the cavern&#39;s heat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The coordinated dragon attack broke the enemy&#39;s will. Their formations shattered, and the remainder of the horde on the far side of the chasm turned and fled, their shrieks of terror echoing through the mountain. The chasm was held. The Dragon Riders and the dwarves had won their first battle, a fierce and costly victory. The defensive line had held without too many losses. An elegant masterclass in the art of battle, won by their tactical cunning.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c15"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c1 c7" id="h.qc303l3m4qgr"><span class="c5">&nbsp;Chapter 5: Battle of Broken Shard Passage</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c2">After the victory in Durin&rsquo;s Chasm, the alliance continued pushing forward through the tunnels and caverns against the goblin horde, until they reached the next strategic defense: a new chasm, behind which the goblins and trolls had established their defense. On the other side, a temporary defensive encampment was established by the dwarves, by the fitting name of Iron Footing. A stalemate was reached and the commanders of the alliance gathered to make a plan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Paladin Gawain, ever the tactician, leaned closer to the map. &ldquo;Their lines are thickest here, betting on the chasm to protect them. We must totally break the line, not simply push it back. A flanking attack is the only way to turn this defense into a rout.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>General Bhor nodded slowly, his eyes narrowing. &ldquo;A flanking attack means a journey through the forgotten paths. And there is only one that we know of around here. The </span><span class="c13">Broken Shard Passage</span><span class="c2">.&rdquo; He pointed to a fissure marked by a faint, ancient dwarven rune, far to the north of their current position. &ldquo;An old mining tunnel, abandoned centuries ago. It is unstable, tight, full of dangerously sharp crystals &nbsp;and runs too close to the main lava streams. It is a death-trap for a full army, and a place where a dragon&rsquo;s wings would be useless.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Alaric&rsquo;s gaze met Vaelor&rsquo;s, who was resting in the great cavern nearby. The human paladin knew the risk, but he also saw the opportunity. This was the kind of daring, unexpected maneuver that would shatter the Goblins&#39; organizational confidence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If it is a death-trap for an army, it will be unguarded by the Goblins,&rdquo; Alaric stated, his voice firm. &ldquo;We will take the Dragon Riders, the dragons going on the ground. We will take an elite unit of your best sappers, General, and we will breach the passage. It will be the fastest, quietest, and most devastating way to hit their flank.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 529.13px; height: 529.13px;"><img alt="" src="images/image13.jpg" style="width: 529.13px; height: 529.13px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The flanking group set out under the cloak of deep darkness. The force was small: Alaric, Knight Caradoc, and two other trusted knights, accompanied by a dozen of General Bhor&rsquo;s most loyal and skilled dwarven engineers. Leaving the main army to keep the Goblins busy with a feint attack over the chasm the goblins were using as a defense, they moved like a shadow, disappearing into the cold, silent opening of the Broken Shard Passage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The journey was a trial. The passage was everything General </span><span>Bhor</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;had warned: a chaotic mess of fractured stone, uneven terrain, shards, and sometimes a suffocating heat that pressed close from the magma flow at the other side of the rocks. The Dragon Riders, trained for the boundless sky and sweeping battlefields, struggled in the close confines. They moved in single file, the sappers in front breaking through the obstacles, the scaled armor of the dragons scraping against the rock, their only light coming from the glowing runes etched into the pickaxes and the helmet lamps of the dwarves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The dwarven sappers were heroes of quiet, unending labor, even using small, expertly placed and sized blasts to clear cave-ins and clear the way. Alaric, despite the oppressive darkness, kept his mind focused on the image of the Goblin lines. He was determined to trade their momentary pain for ultimate victory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">They reached their objective: the passage divided into several openings into the cavern where the goblins were defending from the feint attack over the chasm. But something was wrong: the goblins and trolls had noticed the weakened feint attack due to the missing flanking forces and had decided to counter-attack. They had to hurry to complete the flanking maneuver before the monstrous trolls could cause damage!</span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 529.13px; height: 529.13px;"><img alt="" src="images/image14.jpg" style="width: 529.13px; height: 529.13px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Alaric and his knights charged through the new breach first, emerging directly into the rear of the main Goblin staging cavern. There were thousands of Goblins milling about, their commanders barking orders, wholly unprepared for an attack from behind. The diversion attack had turned into a defense and was about to be overrun by the counterattack over the bridges over the chasm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Vaelor jumped forward into the air and leapt on top of the goblin archers with the help of his wings, to then unleash a devastating torrent of fire that ignited the Goblin ranks. Panic erupted amongst the goblins as their discipline shattered. Alaric and his knights, fighting under the need to seize the opportunity and suppress a bigger enemy, cut down goblin commanders and scattered the squads, while the dwarven sappers followed, hacking the stragglers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sensing the chaos, General Bhor ordered the main army at Iron Footing to charge. When the brutal pincer movement closed, the fate of the Goblin Horde was sealed. Their retreat turned into a panicked, self-destructive stampede. Alaric and the Dragon Riders harassed them from above and behind, driving them through the tunnels, pushing them past their last established defenses, all the way back towards their main capital.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Battle of Broken Shard Passage had achieved the impossible. The alliance had not just pushed the line; they had broken the Goblin army&rsquo;s will and momentum, securing the critical advantage that would lead them to the final battle. The path to the Goblin Burrow was now open.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c15"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c1 c7" id="h.4itbx8qj3st3"><span>Chapter 6: Battle of the Goblin Burrow</span></h1><p class="c1"><span>The entire allied command&mdash;Paladins </span><span class="c10">Alaric</span><span>, </span><span class="c10">Percival</span><span>, and </span><span class="c10">Gawain</span><span class="c2">, having joined with the newly arrived army of the valley, alongside General Bhor&mdash;stood before the mouth of the Burrow. It was not a majestic gate like Khazad-Throm&#39;s, but a filthy, gaping maw of rock, crudely carved and ringed with layers of decaying refuse and sharp, rusting traps.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is their home,&rdquo; General Bhor declared, his voice grim. &ldquo;A labyrinth of tunnels, too small for our formations, too dark for archers, and filled with a thousand ways to die. The Trolls will be here, guarding their King, waiting in ambush to brutally attack our dwarves and men.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Paladin Percival, the wise diplomat, whose long silver-braided hair and calm demeanor belied a fierce warrior&#39;s skill, spoke with measured authority. &ldquo;Our strength is in unity, General, but here, unity would be our perdition. The dragons cannot fly, and a shield wall is useless if the enemy strikes from the ceiling. We must divide, relying on small, elite squads to clear the main arteries.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gawain, ever practical, pointed to three central tunnels on their captured map. &ldquo;General Bhor, you will attack the center with your veterans; you are the anchor that cannot be moved. Through you we will transport orders and materiel to support the flanks. They will try to make advances on their own and if you notice they make an opening for you, push for it and take it. Alaric, you will take a detachment of dragon riders and dwarven goat riders but will lack heavy weapons. Our scouts reveal that you will find entrenched positions with archers and goblin ballistae, so the speed and shock nature of your troops will be perfect to overwhelm them. I will take the left. There I will face Trolls but the human and dwarven spearmen under my command are our best bet to contain them. I will also have some archers and ballistae to try to hurt them from short range, but it won&rsquo;t be easy to use them in such narrow tunnels.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The plan was accepted. The final assault began. The Dragon Riders, their swords drawn and their great beasts moving in the cramped space with unnatural grace, were forced to become tunnel-fighters, relying on their human capability in closed spaces and the brief, concentrated bursts of dragon fire.</span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 529.13px; height: 529.13px;"><img alt="" src="images/image21.jpg" style="width: 529.13px; height: 529.13px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The Goblin Burrow was a hellish, claustrophobic nightmare. The air was hot and stagnant, thick with the stench of filth, crude iron, and sweat. Tunnels twisted and converged into small, echoing chambers where the fighting was a brutal, hacking melee. The Goblins fought with a desperate, trapped fury, striking from side passages and dropping from holes in the ceiling. They were supported by a number of massive </span><span class="c10">Trolls</span><span class="c2">, hulking brutes covered in jagged bone armor, who served as living siege engines to break the allied advance and proved hard to kill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the central tunnel, General Bhor&rsquo;s dwarves advanced with the force of a glacier. Their disciplined shield walls moved as one, absorbing the blows of the Trolls while the dwarven hammers and spears found the weak spots in the beasts&rsquo; defenses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 624.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 624.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span>On the right flank, Alaric and Vaelor were an engine of focused destruction. Where a passage led to a cavern where the goblins had mounted a defense with their archers and ballistae, they jumped to close the distance with brutal attacks before they could get shot at, cutting off escape routes and denying the enemy in any case a chance to rally elsewhere. Neutralizing one node of defense meant that the goblins had to spend their reserve units to stop that vector of advance, alleviating the pressure in the center, so that </span><span>Bhor</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;could advance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>It was Gawain&rsquo;s gruelling advance on the left, however, that gave them a crucial piece of information: they had seen the king of the goblin horde, </span><span class="c10">Grishnak</span><span class="c2">, who had to flee the scene as they slowly gained terrain and they got a hint of where he was headed. Gawain&rsquo;s messenger, an agile elven squire, relayed the information to all other commanders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">After Bhor took a main cavern in the center. The two paladins Alaric and Gawain met on it with General Bhor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;General Bhor, Alaric&rdquo; Gawin explained, &ldquo;Our foe is here, cornered in a cavern nearby! It&rsquo;s time to finish this war.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The goblin reinforcements are still coming from somewhere deeper in the burrow&rdquo; warned Bhor &ldquo;but are forced to use only the bottleneck of the tunnels to the right. I will divert most of my troops to block them, but join you with a squad to defeat the wretched goblin king together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 624.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image18.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 624.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Perched atop a crude throne of piled stone and stolen gold sat the king of the horde: the Goblin King. He was a creature of startling size and vicious cunning, clad in tarnished, goat skin armor and wielding a massive jagged mace that looked as old as the mountain. Around him, a final, elite guard of the largest Trolls stood ready.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bhor bellowed a command, and his dwarves surged forward, forming a massive iron wedge that broke through the remaining Goblin defenses and poured into the cavern. The Trolls guarding Grishnak turned to meet them in a furious, bone-shattering melee.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The dragon riders circled around the cavern, harassing the trolls, spitting fire over them and picking up isolated goblins.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the chaos, King Grishnak spotted Paladin Alaric, the most prominent figure, atop his dragon. With a screech of rage, the Goblin King raised his mace and charged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Alaric dismounted Vaelor, meeting the creature on foot, sword-to-mace. The sheer strength of the Goblin King was surprising, each blow from his weapon threatening to shatter Alaric&rsquo;s shield. But the paladin fought with the trained grace and technique of a Dragon Rider, dodging, weaving, and looking for the fatal opening. Meanwhile, Vaelor, confined by the space, used bursts of fire to protect his rider from the flanks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 624.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image22.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 624.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The climax came when Gawain and Bhor broke through the melee. Gawain engaged a nearby Troll, pulling its attention from the dwarven lines, while Bhor, with a masterful display of precision, hurled a perfectly weighted spear that found the hole in Grishnak&#39;s armor, lodging itself in the Goblin King&#39;s shoulder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">With a guttural cry of pain, the King stumbled. Alaric did not hesitate and finished him with his sword. The Goblin King Grishnak fell, his massive mace clattering on the stone floor, his dark life extinguished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The sight of their King&#39;s death, coupled with the unrelenting dwarven advance and the Dragon Riders&#39; terrifying presence, broke the remaining resistance. The surviving Goblins and Trolls scattered into the deep, forgotten tunnels, their malice replaced by absolute terror. The battle was over. The burrow was cleansed. The combined armies had achieved a hard-won victory, securing the future of the Kingdom Under the Mountain in the claustrophobic confines of the Goblin Burrow. The long, dark war was finally at an end.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c15"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c1 c7" id="h.rb23xqmmfvhl"><span class="c5">Chapter 7: Victory</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the days that followed, the grim work of cleansing the Burrow began. It was a methodical, disciplined process led by the unyielding General Bhor. But for the Dragon Riders, the immediate danger had passed, and the mood shifted from exhaustion to happy celebration. The dwarves laid out a feast in Khazad-Throm&#39;s great throne hall, one not of the refined hospitality of their first diplomatic visit, but of a fierce, brotherly and joyful camaraderie forged in battle. Ale flowed like a river, dwarven songs, loud and deep, echoed through the stone halls, and for the first time in months, King Thordal smiled, his eyes alight with pride.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Paladin Alaric,&rdquo; King Thordal boomed, raising a mug of mead the size of his head. &ldquo;You and your knights have not merely aided us; you have saved Khazad-Throm. We will honor the alliance, and your victory will be sung in our halls for a thousand years.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Alaric, seated with Percival and Gawain, raised his own cup. &ldquo;The victory is yours, King Thordal. It was your courage and the strength of your warriors that anchored our attack. The Dragon Rider Order merely lent the fire. Now, the time has come for us to return and show you our home: the Valley.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The expedition departed a week later, together with dwarven warriors, smiths, and engineers led by King Thordal. The three paladins led the returning party, flying out of the mountain&#39;s secret entrance and into the familiar, welcoming light of the sun. The journey back was one of pure restoration, the wind in their faces a balm after the stagnant air of the Burrow.</span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 623.62px; height: 623.62px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 623.62px; height: 623.62px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span>When they reached the Valley of Dragons, the entire populace was waiting.

River City was draped in banners of dwarven silver and dragon-rider blue. A massive feast was prepared in the great fields near Castle Tarn, meant to celebrate not just the end of the conflict, but the new, formal alliance that promised peace for centuries.</span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 623.62px; height: 623.62px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.jpg" style="width: 623.62px; height: 623.62px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;The darkness under the mountain is defeated,&quot; Alaric proclaimed, his voice ringing with conviction. &quot;And in that victory, a bond of honor has been forged.

Dwarves shared mead with humans, and elven music blended with the deep laughter of the mountain folk. The long night of war was over, and the Valley of Dragons, having saved a distant kingdom, settled once more into a profound and cherished peace, its future more promising than ever.

Borin was a master negotiator, whose deep knowledge of mineral wealth was matched by a surprisingly patient diplomatic temperament.

It was a secluded, stable region far from the areas of the Forest City and the fertile farming plains. There, under Borin&rsquo;s direct supervision, the dwarves established a </span><span class="c10">new mine</span><span>&mdash;not a vast, all-consuming deep-delve like those of Khazad-Throm, but one for moderate, efficient extraction. Dwarven engineers worked in perfect, disciplined synchronization with </span><span>human caravaners </span><span class="c2">and Dragon Rider patrols, creating a well-managed operation that promised a steady supply of high-grade steel, precious gems and the best building stone for the valley&rsquo;s burgeoning needs.</span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 529.13px; height: 529.13px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 529.13px; height: 529.13px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Alongside the mine, the dwarves began construction of a </span><span class="c10">permanent settlement</span><span>. This new community was placed strategically near the beautiful spring of the Silver River, where fresh, clean water flowed down from the heights. It was to be a small, sturdy village of granite houses and iron forges, a permanent, visible testament to the dwarven presence and contribution to the Valley. This </span><span class="c10">dwarven settlement</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;was instantly seen as a wonder, a stark contrast to the human and elven towns, yet a harmonious addition to the Valley&#39;s landscape. The settlement became a bustling hub where the dwarves taught the humans their techniques of superior mining, forging and masonry, exchanging centuries of stone-craft for the valley people&#39;s knowledge of agriculture and open trade. This intermingling of craft and culture strengthened the bond on a level deeper than any treaty.</span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 529.13px; height: 529.13px;"><img alt="" src="images/image16.jpg" style="width: 529.13px; height: 529.13px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The final, crucial step in the alliance was the establishment of the </span><span class="c10">diplomatic office in River City</span><span>. River City, the human center of trade and politics, was the natural location for this permanent fixture. The </span><span class="c10">Mayor of River City</span><span class="c2">, a shrewd but honorable man of commerce, was delighted to welcome Ambassador Borin. A grand, dwarven-styled stone building&mdash;constructed in a matter of weeks&mdash; was set up near the docks, its great, iron-banded doors standing as a symbol of the unbreakable nature of the alliance.</span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 529.13px; height: 529.13px;"><img alt="" src="images/image23.jpg" style="width: 529.13px; height: 529.13px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Borin Stonehand became the anchor of the relationship. He was a constant presence in River City, advising the Mayor&rsquo;s council on many matters, and acting as King Thordal&rsquo;s representative in the valley. This office ensured that the lines of communication were ever warm allowing for swift military coordination and seamless exchange. The dwarves offered their finely-crafted steel and gems in exchange for the valley&rsquo;s abundant grain, timber, tools and medicinal herbs, creating a mutual economy that enriched all parties.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The new reality in the valley was one of a new balance. The Elves&#39; knowledge guarded the forests and magic; the Dragons and their Riders soared the skies as the valley&rsquo;s shield; the Humans managed the vibrant trade and political center of River City; and now, the Dwarves provided an unbreakable foundation of iron and stone, securing the economic and physical future of the free peoples.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The war had been won with fire and steel, but the peace was built with gold, stone, and an unbreakable bond of honor. The Valley of Dragons was no longer just a sanctuary of humans, elves, and dragons; it was the proud, powerful centerpiece of a united front against any future darkness, its strength rooted in the deep mountains and reaching to the highest sky. The legacy of Paladin Alaric&rsquo;s decision to answer the call was complete, ushering in a golden era of peace and prosperity.</span></p><p class="c1 c15"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c21">The End</span></p></body></html>
