<strong>The Paths of Magic</strong>
A boy of the coast, with eyes on the sea,
Dreamed not of fishing, but of what might be.
The tide obeyed this young lad's hand,
And beckoned him forth to a wider land.

Through forest halls where green roots sing,
Through earthbound caves where stone has ring,
He learned that magic, deep and true,
Unfolds its power to hearts that pursue.

The sun gave fire, the wind gave flight,
The storm lent thunder, the dark gave fright.
Yet each new trial, harsh and grand,
Carved his powers like sculptor’s hand.

Atop the tower, with pages worn,
Through liches’ crypts and trials sworn,
Magnus rose with power unfurled,
A student no more, but a mage of this World.

The paths are many, the lesson one:
All things are bound, all hearts are spun.
For magic is not to conquer or prize—
It lives in the seeker, the brave, the wise.
